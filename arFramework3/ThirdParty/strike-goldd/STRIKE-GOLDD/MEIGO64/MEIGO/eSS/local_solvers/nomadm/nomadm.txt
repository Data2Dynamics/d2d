			NOMADm version 3.3
			Summary of Changes


Version 3.3 incorporates the following changes:

NEW FEATURE:

--  A ranking and selection (R&S) procedure for treating stochastic
    optimization problems has been added.  Included in this feature are
    additional R&S user options displayed on the main screen and editable
    via the MADS menu.  In order to edit these parameters, the new Options
    Menu option for running a stochastic problem must be checked.  New R&S
    run parameters are also displayed on the Results screen if the run was
    stochastic.

CODE IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES:

--  The Nadaraya-Watson surrogate functions have been altered and 
    vectorized, with some parameters being moved back into higher mads
    functions so that other classes of surrogates could use them.  The
    input screen has additional parameters that can be tuned.  The crude
    one-dimensional search to optimize the sigma parameter has been replaced
    with an efficient golden section search function.

--  The Latin hypercube function was altered significantly by moving all 
    non-MADS lines of code into the higher level "search" function.  LHS
    is now portable to other applications.  The number of LHS points
    specified by the user now functions exactly that way.

--  A new parameter has been added to allow the pruning of the Cache in
    the construction and recalibration of surrogates.

--  All the view screens have been modified, and several minor bugs were
    corrected.



			NOMADm version 3.2
			Summary of Changes


Version 3.2 started as a minor update, and is still minor when compared to 3.0,
but it has in fact undergone a number of significant changes.  More variable
names have changed and the code has undergone a stylistic and structural
overhaul using "m-lint".  The user interface has been completely remade so
that, rather than use two files and access callback functions through a
switch-case construct, every function is in the same file, with callback
functions handled by storing and retrieving function handles.


NEW FEATURES:

--  The Search function has been modified so that surrogates may be used in
    solving mixed variable optimization problems.  Specifically, surrogates
    are formed using only the Cache points with the same categorical
    variable values as the current poll center or discrete neighbor.  
    This means that multiple surrogates are constructed -- possibly as many
    as one for every set of discrete variable values.

--  An EXTENDED SEARCH step has been added to the MADS algorithm
    immediately preceding the EXTENDED POLL step.  This was done by
    inserting several lines of code, including a call to the Search
    function, inside the mvpPoll function in mads.m.  At each iteration,
    the SEARCH type and parameters used in SEARCH are also be used in
    EXTENDED SEARCH.  While it would not be difficult to allow the user a
    separate EXTENDED SEARCH type (with its own parameters), allowing a
    different EXTENDED SEARCH for each discrete neighbor point would be
    impractical and very difficult to program.

--  Use of Nadaraya-Watson based surrogates has been added as a Search
    option with several 7 different kernel functions.  In doing so, the
    daceSurrogate function has been renamed recalSurrogate and is now used
    to construct both DACE and N-W surrogates, depending on the input
    arguments.  This new function can also handle custom surrogates, in
    which case the user need only supply a simple interface file for using
    an already existing outside surrogate code.

--  A checkbox option has been added to turn on/off the mesh size
    termination criterion.  An error trap has been added to force the user
    to choose at least one stopping condition.


CODE IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

--  The input dialog box launched prior to the Search Input screen has been
    deleted.  The two user choices from the input dialog box were moved
    directly onto the Search input screen as popup menus, so that all
    Search data is now input on one screen in a more convenient manner.

--  Deleted all path restrictions associated with the companion software,
    dace and cmaes.  Now, if the user wishes to use dace or cmaes within
    NOMADm, the user must install the program and add the path where its
    files are stored to the Matlab path.  This is done using the 
    File -->Set Path menu choice from the Matlab command window.

--  Created a new processOutput function and a closeWorkspace function to take
    care of error trapping and bookkeeping at the end of the run.

--  The optimizeSurrogate function has been modified so that it creates
    optimizer-specific surrogate function files only once (rather than
    recreating them at every iteration) and then deletes them after the run is
    complete.  This increases the speed and efficiency of the surrogate
    optimization process.

--  The viewing of best feasible and least infeasible solutions has been
    completely redone.  For each of these two solutions, the two pushbuttons
    for viewing continuous and categorical variables, respectively, have been
    replaced by a single pushbutton for viewing all the variables at once.
    Pressing this "View Solution" button launches a "Solutions" figure window,
    where both categorical and continuous variable values are shown.  If there
    are more than ten of either variable type, "Next" and "Previous"
    pushbuttons appear to allow the user to view the variables up to 10 at a
    time.

--  Changed the way that the number of function evaluations is computed.
    Specifically, a new field, nfunc, was added to Cache, which is a vector
    with each element representing the number of function evaluations performed
    at the corresponding point.  A value of 1 was put into each element of
    Cache.nfunc, so that the sum is the number of function evaluations.  This
    was done for future compatibility with stochastic problems.  Stochastic
    problems typically require multiple function evaluations (replications) at
    each point, which is incompatible with this software because the objective
    and constraint functions are only evaluated a trial point if it is not
    already in the Cache.  The new field allows the user to do several function
    evaluations at the same point outside of NOMADm and store the average as
    the function value and the number of replications in the corresponding
    element Cache.nfunc.

--  Replaced many logical operators & and | with short-circuit logical
    operators && and ||, respectively to increase efficiency.

--  The text color of each entry in the Results Menu now matches the color of
    its curve in the history plot.

--  Corrected a bug in mads_batch.m that generated a new figure window at every
    iteration whenever real-time filter or history plotting was turned on.

--  Corrected a bug that caused an error whenever the minimum constraint
    violation function value was set to zero.

--  Removed an error flag that disallowed more than one Cache hit at a time.
    This was done because it is possible for this to happen.  If a trial point
    is in very close proximity to a Cache point but just outside the threshold
    for being a Cache hit, it is added to the Cache.  Then, if a third point
    lies between these two points, it could fall beneath the Cache Hit
    threshold for both points simultaneously, thus yielding two Cache hits at
    the same time.

--  Corrected a bug that made the lhs function incompatible with the
    removeRedundancy flag being turned on (the default case) whenever linear
    constraints are degenerate or variables are unbounded.  Since lhs needs the
    original constraints (before redundant ones are removed), the fix was to
    turn the flag off inside the search routine and call updateOmega before
    calling lhs.

--  Corrected a bug in changeProblem, in which the Matlab path was being
    altered in an undesirable way.  Specifically, if the user selected a
    problem stored in the NOMADm directory, and then chose another problem in a
    different directory, then the first directory would be deleted from the
    path, even if it was required to run the software.  A logical variable was
    added so that, if the selected problem was already on the Matlab path, the
    path would not be deleted.

--  Fixed a bug that prevented the user from choosing the Cancel button on the
    DACE figure window.

--  Cleaned up some major bugs in ga and added a new getPenaltyTerm function
    that the ga function uses to compute a penalty parameter in the case of 
    nonlinear constraints.

--  Corrected minor bugs in the search, processInput, getTangentCone,
    evalFunction, and nomadm_compile functions.


			NOMADm Version 3.00
			Summary of Changes


NOMADm 3.00 has many new features, improvements, and corrections.  The code has
been extensively rewritten to make it faster, more efficient, and more
compatible with typical MATLAB conventions.  Documentation includes a new
User's Guide to replace the html help file, a Contents file, and this summary
of changes.

Many variable names have changed, making existing user cache and session files
incompatible with the new code.  Since session files are not difficult to
quickly reproduce, no attempt has been made to transition these files.  Old
cache files are incompatible because of a new field in the "iterate" structure,
called pID, which is described below.  To transition an old cache with the file
name of MyProblem_Cache.mat, the following code should work to update it:

    load('MyProblem_Cache',CACHE);
    [CACHE.iterate.pID] = deal(0);
    save('MyProblem_Cache',Cache);


NEW FEATURES:

-- The new mesh adaptive direct search (MADS) algorithm has been added to what
was GPS by adding a new function, madsDirections, which generates the
appropriate POLL directions.  It can be run with or without the filter, and
it can use a 2n or n+1 positive basis.  Most references to GPS within the code
and documentation have been replaced with the more general MADS terminology.

-- The SEARCH step options have been greatly enhanced to allow a different
SEARCH type to be employed at various times.  The user can now specify
parameters for each of N searches, namely, the type of search, number of
iterations to run the search, number of points to sample, and the filename of a
user-provided search routine.

-- Initial implementation of DACE surrogates as a SEARCH option has been added.
The DACE package comes from researchers at DTU in Denmark.  Whenever this
SEARCH type is selected from the Search options menu, a DACE popup window is
launched which takes various options as input.  The DACE surrogate is
recalibrated and then optimized using either MADS, fmincon (from the Matlab
Optimization Toolbox) or the genetic algorithm package CMA-ES (from Germany).
The option to use MADS is not recommended because it has not been fully tested
and is VERY slow on the simplest of problems.

-- A new function, processC, was added to the package, which enables the user
to run MADS on problems in which the Functions file is written in "C".  If the
functions file has not already been pre-compiled, then processC combines the
Functions file with the appropriate commands for the Matlab mex compiler,
compiles the code for the appropriate platform, and passes the filename to the
optimizer so that the optimizer can seamlessly process and use the executable
file.  Since the user should also be able to do this before running NOMADm, all
the files for processing C and FORTRAN files were removed from the file,
nomadm_functions.m, and stored under a new parent file, nomadm_compile.m.

-- A new function, removeRedunancy, co-written with Olga Brezhneva, has been
added to handle degenerate linear constraints.  An option has been added to
allow the user to discard redundant constraints before beginning the iteration
(via a more expensive approach, but done only once).  If this option is not
selected, then deletion of redundant constraints is treated as needed within
the new function during the iteration process.

-- New poll order options have been added.  The "Custom" option allows the user
to specify a poll order in the parameter file.  "Dynamic" poll ordering changes
at every successful iteration, moving the previous successful direction (or, in
MADS, the direction making the closest angle) to the top of the order.  
"Dynamic Ranked" orders all the directions according to how small an angle they
make with the previous successful direction.  "Surrogate" order does polling in
order of surrogate value.

-- A genetic algorithm code has been added as an additional SEARCH option.

-- Deterministic sampling on a coarse mesh has been added as an additional
SEARCH option.

-- A maximum mesh size parameter has been added to prevent the mesh from
getting too coarse.

-- A user option for accelerating convergence has been added.  It divides the
mesh refinement factor in half at every unsuccessful iteration.

-- A termination criterion has been added that stops if the user sets a maximum
number of consecutive POLL failures.

-- A flag option has been added to the Run menu that allows the user to run the
optimizer one iteration at a time, allowing for a change in parameters between
iterations.

-- An option has been added to the Run menu that allow the user to seek the
first feasible point (with respect to the constraints in the Functions file),
rather than seek the optimizer.

-- The Cache Tolerance and MVP EXTENDED POLL triggers for the objective and
constraint violation functions may now be edited by selecting the appropriate
MADS menu choice.

-- An option has been added to do base-2 or base-10 logarithmic scaling of
directions.

-- Custom POLL directions has been added to allow user to specify the
underlying POLL directions basis.

-- Options have been added to the NOMADm Help menu to allow viewing of the GNU
General Public License (GPL) and this summary of changes.

-- The html NOMADm Help file has been replaced with a more complete pdf User's
Guide.

-- Code documentation has been updated and improved to comply with current
MATLAB standards for using "help" and "lookfor" commands.  A "Contents.m" file
has been added as an overview for the package.


CODE IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES:

-- The Stop Run and Resume features are now much more stable and clearly
defined, and push buttons for both are now included.  Some capability existed
before, but the seamless transition of variable values was not entirely
accurate.  This has been corrected.

-- The Cache has a new field .pID and a function to compute its value.  This
field is a unique ID number corresponding to a specific set of categorical
variable values.  This speeds up searching the Cache, and it allows
partitioning of that part of the Cache with the same discrete variable values.
As a consequence, this greatly improves the process for scaling directions in
the case of mixed variables.

-- Computation of scale factors was moved from the Update function to the
updateOmega function to facilitate scaling of MVP problems.

-- The actual scaling of directions was moved to from the poll function to the
various functions that compute POLL directions, so that a bug could be
corrected to prevent tangent cone generators from being scaled.

-- Added code in the updateOmega function to scale each linear constraint by
the infinity norm of its coefficients.

-- The "Constraints change ..." options in the Problem Menu has been deleted.
Instead, whether or not to change the linear constraints during the
optimization of an MVP problem is determined by the number of input arguments
(1 or 2) that the Omega file function statement has.  If a second argument
(the current values of the categorical variables) is included, then it is
assumed that Omega is dependent on these values; otherwise, it is assumed that
the linear constraints never change.

-- The "Search Cache before Evaluating Function" menu choice has been removed
as a user option.  Because the Cache structure is integrated so tightly into
the code, not selecting this option has resulted in too many unforeseen
problems.  Therefore, this function is now always done automatically.

-- Reduced the size of the processInput function by putting the error checks in
a separate function and moving all of the Cache construction and retrieval
logic to the createCache function.

-- For problems with no nonlinear constraints, the constraint violation
function value no longer appears in the results display window.

-- The filter now displays on the bottom right of the main window to allow for
the display of more options.

-- Minor bugs in DVector, LHS, and gradDirections were corrected.

-- Added two lines to getTangentCone to zero out elements that are less than
10*eps in magnitude.

-- Added an error check in gradDirections to prevent an infinite loop if
user-provided derivatives are in error.
