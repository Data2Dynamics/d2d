% The ar struct contains most of the data used for all model analyses
%
%     - res                 Residual
%     - sres                Sensitivity of the residual (here the observables and parameters are specified in whatever space they are fitted (log or not))
%     - constr              Constraint based residuals
%     - chi2                Sum of squared residuals (when fitting errors, this is *not* the objective function)
%                             Given by sum( ar.model.data.res^2 )
%     - chi2err             Sum of error residuals
%                             Given by sum(ar.model.data.reserr.^2) + ar.config.add_c * sum(ar.model.data.reserr>0)
%                             These come from the normalization constant of the likelihood which needs to be taken into account when estimating sigma.
%                             Note that the add_c term comes from the fact that we need to provide a residual to lsqnonlin. Since the normalization term is proportional to
%                             sqrt(ln(sigma)+add_c), the add_c is used to ensure positivy under the sqrt. It is later subtracted again when computing the objective function.
%     - chi2constr          Sum of squared constraint residuals.
%                             Given by sum(ar.constr.^2)
%     - chi2fit             Sum of squared residuals and error residuals (this is typically the objective function when there are no constraints).
%                             Given by ar.chi2 + ar.chi2err
%                             Hint: the log likelihood can be computed as 2*ar.ndata*log(sqrt(2*pi)) + ar.chi2fit;

%     - qDynamic            Vector of logicals which indicate whether parameter affects dynamics
%     - qError              Vector of logicals which indicates whether it is an error model parameter
%     - qInitial            Vector of logicals which indicates whether a parameter is an initial condition
%     - lb/ub               Lower and upper bounds for the parameters (note that depending on qLog10 they are in logspace or not)
%     - p                   Parameter values (note that depending on qLog10 they are in logspace or not)
%     - type                Type of prior (0=box, 1=normal, 2=uniform with normal bounds, 3=L1 prior)
